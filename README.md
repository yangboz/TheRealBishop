TheRealBishop
=============

Standalone the source code from https://github.com/yangboz/godpaper/tree/master/TheRealBishop

#About:

TheRealBishop project code base translated on TheKnightErrant by ActionScript3 language.

Also based on the great open source project Sparrow framework.

#Notes and tips:

1.All of AS3 featured "protected/private" function translate to "public" at Obj-c level;

2.All of AS3 featured "interface" functions translate to "protocol" at Obj-c level;

3.All of AS3 featured "internal class" must be seperated as stand-alone class files at Obj-c level;

4.All of AS3 single class files must be seperated ".h" && ".m" files at Obj-c level;(except Obj-c protocol)

#TODO list:

1.an objective-c "Vector" template class implementation required;

2.more unit test on "ds" relevant class and protocol class files;

3.double check the objective-c pointer and reference translation;


#Known issues:
1.Obj-c properties at protocol implementation issues;
2.Obj-c dynamic function required;
#Wish list:
